If I had more time I'd worked on the followin:

1. Include more test cases.
   > Negative inputs
   > duplicate entries
   > date format
2. For reporting , testNG is better
   > Include testNG in the runner class
   > Add extent reporting, for better readabily.
   
3. Improve the documentation, comments.
